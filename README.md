# PRStrategyPlanner

This project aim to experiment UIDynamicKit, CoreAnimation and basic of MVVM.

Some instructions:
- Tap on a row to deploy power rangers, tap on the row again to remove it. There are animations when they show up and disappear.
- You can drag power rangers around, I also added physical collisions effect to make it cooler!
- This project is using MVVM, but I tried to not use RXSwift to keep it simple and also to experiment a binding approach by myself.
